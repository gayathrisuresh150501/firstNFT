# Title: NFT Marketplace Creation
## Requirements: Installation of the following dependencies:
- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/): Programming language to write smart contracts. 
- [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript): For using front-end dev and back-end testing tools.
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/): Testing tool and a JS framework.
- [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/): A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol
designed to preserve and grow humanity's knowledge
by making the web upgradeable, resilient, and more open.
  - [NFT.storage](https://nft.storage/): It is a long-term storage service designed for off-chain NFT data (like metadata, images, and other assets) for up to 31GiB in size per individual upload. Data is content addressed using IPFS, meaning the URI pointing to a piece of data (“ipfs://…”) is completely unique to that data (using a content identifier, or CID). IPFS URLs and CIDs can be used in NFTs and metadata to ensure the NFT forever actually refers to the intended data (eliminating things like rug pulls, and making it trustlessly verifiable what content an NFT is associated with).
- [React routers](https://v5.reactrouter.com/): Navigational components.
- [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/): It is a library that aims to be a complete and compact library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain.
- [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/):  Etherscan allows you to explore and search the Ethereum blockchain for transactions, addresses, tokens, prices and other activities taking place on Ethereum (ETH).

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/): A software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/): It is a PaaS.
- [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/): A solidity library of reusable and secure smart contracts and provides a   complete suite of security products to build, manage, and inspect all aspects of software development and operations for Ethereum projects.
